CycloAnt2 is a cyclic peptide sequencing algorithm, which combine ant colony optimization and local search.This project was built as part of Master's thesis and publication at https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3071178.3071239. Details of the project can be found in publication link.

Two options are provided in the code file. User can run a batch test or a single execution. To run a single execution, input file should be provided. example.txt is the input file format. No input file is reuired to run batch test as batch test data is hardcoded in the code file.User need to comment out appropiriate commands from the block "if __name__ == '__main__':" to select between batch test or single execution.

This version was tested with Anaconda3-4.1.1-Windows-x86.

command to run from command prompt in windows to run a single execution:

Genome_assembly_genetic47.py<example.txt

command to run from command promt in windows to run batch test:
